Premise:
By some clerical error in WaterlooWorks, our protagonist got an offer from a big tech company as a Junior Software Developer. They know they are surely under-qualified, but what-the-hey, the proposition for free meals and unlimited snacks meant the offer was accepted anyways!  Write an day’s entry in their journal, as our protagonist fakes it till they make it!

Day 1:
Dear diary,
First time touching a computer! The mechanical keyboard sounds GREAT!!!

What's this "Microsoft Word" that everyone keeps talking about? Probably not that important!

Day 2:
Dear diary,
I hope they don't find out how much I've lied on my resume! I honestly don't know half of the words on there.

Day 3:
Dear diary,
honestly, I have no idea what this company does... what even is Google?

Got asked if my code was almost done this morning... am I supposed to be done? I still haven't finished the design recipe? Anyway, spent the rest of the day hiding on the toilet...... hope it goes better tomorrow.

Day 4:
Dear diary,
I was stuck on a problem today. I went on stack overflow and copied the whole solution. It somehow worked. I am very happy.

Day 5:
Dear diary,
Today I learned copy and paste! Ran into a little problem though: when I right clicked on a file and copied it on my computer and quickly unplug my mouse and plugged it on my colleague's computer and tried to paste the file, it didn't work!!! Why??? I thought I did it fast enough!
[ Today my co-workers were talking something about a python. I'm really scared of snakes, so I was really scared when my manager told me to use a python to complete my project. ]

Dear diary,
Haven't left the toilet yet... Not sure what to do from here. What day is it today? 
I ran out of snacks 36 hours ago...I need to get more snacks next time.

Day 7:
Dear diary,
Learned about git today. Made my first commit! Hope my coworkers didn't notice...

Day 7.5:
Dear diary,
woke up in the hospital today... guess they found me after I passed out and fell off the toilet?
Hope I don't lose my job!

Day 10:
Dear Diary,
My palms are sweaty//
Knees weak, arms are heavy//
I shouldn't have applied to this job//
But I did it while eating mum's spagheti!//

Roses are red,

They're giving out free food,
But where's my shirt?

Day 15:
Dear diary,
Boss asked me to make a webpage for an upcoming event. Had to ask my friend Joshua to do it at the cost of sharing the reward with him. #FriendInNeedIsFriendIndeed

Day 19:
Dear diary,
One of my coworkers lost his stick and I found it in the washroom. He has all his codes in it. If i steal these code I won't have any works for the next 3 days! Should I take it?

Day 20:
Dear Diary,

I haven't had a single meal today.
I am going to Lazezz after this.

Day 20.5:
Dear, Diary,

Never mind, Lazezz's closed...
I'm going home.

Day 21:
Dear diary,
My co-worker Samuel "confessed" he was jealous of me since I have done such great projects. 
Little does he know he is more skilled than I am. He was maybe trying to make me feel nice, but instead I was feeling worse about myself. 
But whatever! As long I am sustaining myself, that's all that matters! #SelfCareIsImportant

Day 22:
I promise to submit the code today but I don't have anything done. Told them my mom had a car accident and I have to go to the hospital. I got the pessmison to submit it tomorror. 




Day 23:
Dear diary,
I am no longer allowed to have a sandwich, an umbrella, or a bobble-head after today's incident. They say the stains'll come out. Eventually. And that the pencil-pushers are mostly in one piece.

Day 24:
My boss said I did a great job on the last project I did. I took it from the stick that I found in the washroom. Hope the owner of the stick doesn't find out!

Day 25:
Dear diary,
A suspicious-of-my-brilliant-skills co-worker asked me to point an error in her code.
I randomly pointed to a line. She shouted excitely, "Darn those semi-colons!! Thanks. You can go now."

Day 28:

Dear Diary, 

Today something called a program manager asked to speak with me. I don't know what that means, but they said something about reviewing my progress for marketing.
I have ano hour to prep, or get a head start. they're bound to find the truth out.

written by: Jamie Feldman

Day 28.2:

Dear Diary, 

I still don't know what a program manager is or what they do but I don't think they are on to me. Just made some stuff up about ML, and AI to enhance cloud connected data analysis to optamize customer experience.
They seemed to believe me, even gave me a waterbottle...like I don't already have a million of those.
