Premise: 
By some clerical error in WaterlooWorks, our protagonist got an offer from a big tech company as a Junior Software Developer. They know they are surely under-qualified, but what-the-hey, the proposition for free meals and unlimited snacks meant the offer was accepted anyways!  Write an day’s entry in their journal, as our protagonist fakes it till they make it!

Day 1:
Dear diary,
What's this "Microsoft Word" that everyone keeps talking about? Probably not that important! 

Day 2:
Dear diary,
I hope they don't find out how much I've lied on my resume! I honestly don't know half of the words on there.

Day 3:
Dear diary,
Got asked if my code was almost done this morning... am I supposed to be done? I still haven't finished the design recipe? Anyway, spent the rest of the day hiding on the toilet...... hope it goes better tomorrow.

Day 4:
Dear diary,
I was stuck on a problem today. I went on stack overflow and copied the whole solution. It somehow worked. I am very happy.

Day 6:
Dear diary,
Haven't left the toilet yet.... Not sure what to do from here. Toilet water has been keeping me hydrated, 
but I ran out of snacks 36 hours ago...

Day 7:
Dear diary,
Learned about git today. Made my first commit! Hope my coworkers didn't notice...

Day 7.5:
Dear diary,
woke up in the hospital today... guess they found me after I passed out and fell off the toilet?
Hope I don't lose my job!

Day 10:
Dear Diary,
My palms are sweaty//
Knees weak, arms are heavy//
I shouldn't have applied to this job//
But I did it while eating mum's spagheti!//
